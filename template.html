My current body of work is titled Pneuma which was Inspired by my readings of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor (AD 121-180), who wrote Meditations. Based on the philosophy of Stoicism or Stoic thought, “pneuma” pertains to the soul, the vital spirit, or creative force of a person or from the Greek origin “that which is breathed or blown.” I examine breath in relation to the pandemic situation today.

Like an archaeologist, my exploration and vision depict life between the layers of time, the unknown and the breaths we take. Through the medium of photography and sculptural objects, I strive to convey and capture a reflection of the pandemic moments that portray the roots of our existence.
