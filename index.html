          This work is part of a broader engagement of illustrations that take on critical perspectives about the world around us. At OCAD University, students, fellow instructors, and staff have been coping with the difficult challenges caused by COVID-19; finishing classes and assignments, while coping with the stress and fear of a pandemic. Like a horror film that is dreadfully real, people continue to die and live in fear all over the world. COVID-19 possesses an insurmountable myriad of unknowns that have us fighting for our lives and livelihoods as we transition to new ways of being.

          <h3>A people centred response to COVID-19</h3>
        </div>

    <div class="eight columns">
      

      <p>
      <span class='sc'>March 11, 2020</span> At the outset, COVID-19 presented as unpredictable and constantly evolving. But now, in the wake of China, Italy, Iran and South Korea - we already have a playbook on how the virus spreads and containment strategies that work. Canada’s response has been slow and our government leaders are under-reacting to a global pandemic. It is estimated that 30 to 60 percent of the world’s population will get infected. There is still little known about the virus and no vaccine. In the face of this crisis, what is Canada’s plan? Unfortunately, there isn't a comprehensive national plan. We have the private sector making choices on their own and voluntary cancellations. Across the country, the confusion is clear and Provinces are coming up with contradictory recommendations. At the airport, incoming travellers are invited to self-report. There is no national ban on large public gatherings. Italy is in lockdown because they took too long to build a plan. China now seems to have flattened the curve because the state forced self-isolation. But here in Canada, we have a new committee and are told to proceed with ‘caution’. This is a pacification approach. 
      </p>

      <p>
      I just received a message from an elected official that reassured me ’the risk remains low’. I do not believe this to be the case. There is real concern the spread in the community has already started. The Liberal government’s statements place a priority on ‘minimizing social disruption’. That is code word for economic disruption. Instead of calculating how much money will be lost, we need immediate steps to ensure there is not one unnecessary death. Why wait to take steps to protect people. Unless keeping things open to make money is more important than people’s lives?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Canadians need a people’s centred response to COVID-19, led by scientists and health care workers not neo-liberal economists. Temporary and immediate measures must be put in place and timely, accessible communication channels with Canadians need to be set up. Canada needs to be shut down to slow the spread of infection. All non-essential travel in/out of the country or domestically must cease for 30 days. Anyone coming with symptoms must be tested immediately. And people need to know where to get tested locally. Workplaces, schools and daycares must be closed. Anyone not working in essential services, needs to stay home and have the support to do so. Grocery stores, pharmacies and health centres will be points of contact, and they need to be given support to be points of information for people. Supplies of hand sanitizers, protective devices and test kits must be made readily available. South Korea set up the capacity to run 10,000 tests a day within days of the outbreak.  
      </p>

      <p>
      Canadians also need information and access to specific advice through properly staffed tele-health and public health services. Quarantine, crisis health operations, social distancing and rudimentary hygiene practice works. Outside of a vaccine, containment strategies are the most readily available & effective protections we have against COVID-19. But this won’t happen until its too late because the ’social disruption’ will be too costly. This means the political cost is being carefully weighed, this is unconscionable. Lives are at stake.  
      </p>

      <p>
      I am fully prepared to batten down the hatches and work internally, within our communities, to protect our friends and family members. And the very first priority should be people who are most vulnerable to transmission or unable to practice the known protocols that work. We need to slow down the spread of the virus to win time for people to develop immunity, hopefully develop a vaccine and to prevent the health care system from becoming overwhelmed. What COVID-19 reveals is the pressing need to have a well funded comprehensive and accessible universal public health care system. Now more than ever, we need to ensure that access to the potential vaccine is affordable for all. Universal pharmacare would ensure private drug companies do not have the opportunity to speculate profitably on the roll-out of a vaccine.  
      </p>

      <p>
      The 1 Billion package announced by Trudeau needs to prioritize resources for those who will be hit the hardest. This includes people living in institutions - nursing homes, prisons, women’s shelters and homeless shelters, those who cannot control their space and for whom ’social distancing’ is impossible, like migrant workers. People here are forced to live in crowded conditions, many are elderly and managing chronic health conditions with scarce resources. They need resources and staffing assistance to practice precautions to stay as safe as possible. Many health care workers are poorly paid, who will replace them or support them if and when they become too sick to work? 
      </p>

      <p>
      The federal government must immediately connect with indigenous leaders to identify their needs and provide assistance. We’re told repeatedly to wash our hands. Many Indigenous communities are on boil water alerts and do not have access to clean, running water.  
      </p>

      <p>
      Self-isolation is not practical unless funds are provided for everyone who needs them in order to stay home. People will not stay home when they should or for as long as they should, if it means they cannot feed their families. The federal government should use our national EI program to provide fast relief to everyone who needs it, including those who are currently ineligible, at levels that actually reflect the cost of living.  
      </p>

      <p>
      Anyone who is left out of emergency planning is most at risk, and that leaves us all at risk. Our very first priority should be people who are most vulnerable to transmission or unable to practice the known protocols that work. 
      </p>

      <p>
      In times like this, we need leadership that is willing to make the tough decisions no one wants to make. The attitude right now seems to be ‘let’s keep the economic wheels on as long as we can’. Why do we have to wait until the number of cases get to a certain point? We’ve seen what happened in China and Italy. Why is Canada going to be any different? We hear the message: ‘don’t panic’. That is underestimating the intelligence and capacity of ordinary people. It’s not panicking to retreat from transmission sites. It’s sober, sound and a reasonable response  
      </p>

      <p>
      We need to be acting as though we are in the middle of a pandemic. Because we are. We need to suck it up, with the hope of averting a larger crisis. We need to start talking about solutions and working together to defeat COVID-19, by pushing the government to act.

The State of Blackness: From Production to Presentation was a two-day, interdisciplinary conference event held at the Ontario College of Art and Design University, and Harbourfront Centre for the Arts, Toronto, Canada. It brought together forty-two (42) artists, curators, academics, students, and multiple public participants to engage in dialogue and, in effect, problematize the histories, current situation, and future state of black diasporic artistic practice and representation in Canada. The site also serves as a repository for information about ongoing research geared toward making visible the artistic production and dissemination of works by Black Canadian cultural producers.

 </p>

 <p>
  JUNE PAK was born in Seoul, South Korea, and now lives in Toronto, Canada. Coming from her personal experience of living in Canada as Korean-Canadian, the hyphenated identity is a central theme in her practice. Questions, debates, and confrontations around the method of visualization of ethnicity, within the framework of visibility and invisibility, continue to arise in her work. Her multi-disciplinary works have shown in Canada and abroad. She received numerous grants for her projects from Canada Council for the Arts, Ontario Arts Council, and Toronto Arts Council. She was awarded the K.M Hunter Artist Award in Visual Arts (2004) and the Chalmers Arts Fellowship for her research in Korea (2017). She teaches as a sessional lecturer at the University of Toronto (Visual Studies program) and at OCAD University (Cross-Disciplinary Art and Integrated Media Programs).

In this short video, we see the range of what is considered essential, bankers and maintenance workers, and we ask what defines the essential service in our society. It points out the fact that many of the people who were often invisible in their labour and roles became visible during the nation-wide lockdown due to COVID-19.

At the time COVID-19 was beginning to infect Canadians, there was an Indigenous resistance movement utilizing the hashtag #shutdowncanada: where the defenders of the land organized actions upon the railways as a means to purposely slow the flow of capital. The railway was chosen as a site of struggle because the resistance was cognizant of the fact that the best way to get any government to listen to our concerns, was through creating an obstruction to what government has always prioritized most-which is the economy. Ironically the flow of global capital has now been #shutdown by COVID-19 and the world is witness to the revitalization of nature -because of it. Western science has been warning us about a variety of cataclysms that would arrive as a result of climate change. Scientists also advised world governments to listen to the guidance of Indigenous people(s) ecological knowledge- as a means of countering the developing crisis, because we’ve also been warning humanity against the destructive nature of this cannibalistic type of resource capitalism. Though the ‘developed world’ carried on consuming the earth’s resources, without heeding any of the warnings. They/the ‘developed world’ acted as if they believed themselves to be immune to the crisis/virus. And those who willfully remained ignorant or opposed the warnings and continued on with their misguided attempts to control/commodify/colonize nature -can now forever be damned in history -as the root cause of COVID-19. Will the governments of the world finally take course on the prescriptions proposed by indigenous knowledge and science and move toward a paradigm shift for the sake of  humanity?

        <h3>TRUST</h3>
        
 


<p>
Who can we trust? Whose words will rescue us? 
 </p>

<p>
When I was growing up in Spanish Town Jamaica, people had two different types of <strong>currencies</strong> in conducting <strong>commerce</strong>; you could pay in cash for something or you could trust it. “Mi madah sen’ mi fi <strong>trust</strong> a loaf of harddough bread and some <strong>butter</strong> ‘till Friday.”  Trust as a popular currency and was both <strong>transactional and relational</strong>; the way it should be. In some communities it was more popular than cash. Trust was <strong>metaphysical</strong> in the way that it moved through space and time to <strong>materialize</strong> goods to sustain life. There was a rhythm and recurrence to the cycle of trust and predictability to the <strong>promise</strong> of payment. For these folks, the shopkeeper would just make a mental note. For those who had a harder time of meeting their basic needs, the shopkeeper would keep a kind of ledger. It was such an <strong>honour</strong> system that those who were on rock-hard times and couldn’t deliver on the promise to pay, were cause for great <strong>sympathy</strong> and even charity.  What was owed would be suspended indefinitely or simply forgiven and in <strong>addition</strong> would be given what they needed for free. If you messed up, the consequences were great. Simply, you would not be given any more <strong>credit</strong>; your currency of trust could not be used again for anything or with anyone. You felt ashamed. There was an <strong>instinct</strong> that told you that you were part of an ecosystem and you had <strong>damaged</strong> it. 
</p>
<p>
In a rum shop where trust had been broken, a sign warned; “In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash”. 
</p>
 
<p>
I remember a time when a person was as <strong>good</strong> as their word as a <strong>societal norm</strong>.  Our need to trust and be trusted was once <strong>fundamental</strong> to who we are as <strong>individuals</strong> and as a society. <strong>Accountability</strong> was a badge of honour. I would venture to say that between immoral <strong>priests</strong>, crooked <strong>politicians</strong> and <strong>falsehood</strong> in advertisements, the <strong>public</strong> notion of trust took a <strong>beating</strong>. And not to overlook <strong>dishounourable</strong> authority figures, unconscionably greed of business cultures, the <strong>Madoffs of the world, alternative facts</strong>, and the all too commonplace Hydro-One type debacles further impugning notions of public trust and <strong>normalizing</strong> its demise. The <strong>private</strong> notions were always complicated and contested, what with the rate of <strong>infidelity</strong>, incest and sexual abuse all from the very <strong>people</strong> one should trust the most. A lost of private and public trusts is <strong>psychic abuse</strong>. 
</p>
 
<p>
I am reminded of an anecdote of a man who had fallen down a cliff and had grabbed onto and hung from a branch of a jotting root, <strong>dangling</strong> above jagged rocks. He pleaded; “God, I know you’re up there. I have complete trust in you, please tell me what to do.” After a short electric pause a <strong>god-like</strong> voice boomed back, “Yes, son it’s me God, just relax and let go. You’re gonna be alright.” 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The man</strong> glanced down at the eager jaggedness of rocks dozens of feet below then frightfully tightened his grip and shouted in an <strong>existential</strong> desperate tone; 
</p>

<p>
“Hey, is <strong>anybody else</strong> up there?” 
</p>

<p>
In some ways, I think that is where <strong>we</strong> are in <strong>the world</strong> today.  
</p>

Trapped in my very small house with my family while swimming in a never-ending sea of baked goods, booze and ambiguity in the early days of the lockdown, I made these in response to a request for Covid-themed art from an art gallery in New Mexico about a month into the plague. I think they may have posted them in some online exhibition, but I forgot to even check or care. I have never been able to remember my dreams, but can tell that they had gotten much weirder with Covid. Maybe that was my motivation? These collages are cobbled together from airline magazines, from the days when travel was possible, LCBO magazines and other cooking magazines that were waiting for the recycling bin. A month later and a few extra pounds later, the dreams continue as does the baked goods, booze and ambiguity. Trapped.
